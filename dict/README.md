# Dict

Dict is a dictionary, a map with strings for keys.
JavaScript objects are dictionaries with some limitations on the domain of
keys.
The dictionary implementation harnesses a single JavaScript object and fully
opens the domain of expressible keys, implementing the gamut of map-like
collection methods.

```
npm install @collections/dict
