# Set

Set is a collection of unique values, in order of least to most recently
inserted equivalent value.

```
npm install @collections/set
```

The Set uses a List of values to track the order of insertion, and a
FastSet to index nodes of the list.

You can override the setâ€™s `hash` and `equals` operators for alternate
indexing.
Favor the native implementation of Set if you do not need the extended
collection.
