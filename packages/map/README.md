# Map

Map is a collection of {key, value} entries indexed by key, iterated in order of
least to most recently added key.

```
npm install @collections/map
```

The map uses a Set of {key, value} entries, indexed by key.
The Set, in turn, uses a List of entries to track the order of insertion, and a
FastSet to index nodes of the list.

**Configurability.**
You can override the mapâ€™s `hash`, `equals`, and `getDefault` operators for
alternate indexing.
Favor the native implementation of Map if you do not need the extended
collection.
