# GenericSet

The GenericSet is an abstract implementation of many common methods of sets.

The set implementation must provide `add`, `addEach`, `has`, `delete`, and
`constructClone`.
Based on these implementations, the GenericSet provides `union`,
`intersection`, `difference`, `symmetricDifference`, `equals`, `contains`,
`remove`, and `toggle`.

```
npm install @collections/generic-set
