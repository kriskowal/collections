# Iterator

Iterator provides a rich interface for iteration, based on the JavaScript
iterator protocol.

```
npm install @collections/iterator
```

The Iterator constructor upgrades iterators that merely implement `next` into a
feature-rich iterator with methods like `map`, `filter`, `takeWhile`, and
`dropWhile`.

The iterator constructor also provides functions like `count`, `repeat`, and
`cycle` for creating common iterations from scratch.
